title:20 Calculate Dot and Cross Product of Two Vectors - Python
tags: Python

```Python
import numpy as np

# Define the two vectors
vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Calculate the dot product
dot_product = np.dot(vector1, vector2)
print('Dot Product:', dot_product)

# Calculate the cross product
cross_product = np.cross(vector1, vector2)
print('Cross Product:', cross_product)
```
